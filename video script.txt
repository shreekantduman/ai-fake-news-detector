Script for Project Video: AI Fake News Detector
1. Introduction (0:00 – 0:30)

Visual: You on camera or project title slide.
Dialogue:

“Hello, my name is Shreekant Suman. In this video, I’ll be presenting my project: AI Fake News Detector. This system is designed to automatically detect fake news from text, URLs, or even images, using a combination of Machine Learning, NLP, OCR, and knowledge verification.”

2. Motivation (0:30 – 1:00)

Visual: Examples of fake news articles or social media screenshots.
Dialogue:

“With the rise of misinformation on social media, detecting fake news has become critical. Manual verification is slow and error-prone. This project aims to provide an automated, reliable, and multilingual tool to identify fake or misleading news.”

3. Technologies Used (1:00 – 1:40)

Visual: Show logos or brief list of technologies.
Dialogue:

“The project uses several technologies:

Python and Flask for the web interface.

OCR (pytesseract) to extract text from news images.

Deep Translator for multilingual support.

spaCy for Named Entity Recognition and text preprocessing.

Machine Learning using scikit-learn to classify news as fake or real.

Wikipedia API and NewsAPI for cross-verifying factual claims.

Optional Hugging Face NLI server to detect contradictions in claims.”

4. How It Works – Pipeline Overview (1:40 – 2:30)

Visual: Flow diagram showing steps: Input → OCR → Translation → NLP → ML → Wiki/NewsAPI → Optional NLI → Result.
Dialogue:

“Here’s how the system works:

Users can input text, a URL, or an image of a news article.

If it’s an image, OCR extracts the text.

The text is translated to English if needed and preprocessed.

Named entities such as persons, organizations, or positions are extracted.

The system checks the content against NewsAPI and Wikipedia to verify facts.

A pre-trained ML model classifies the text as real or fake.

Optionally, the NLI server evaluates the claim for contradictions, further refining the prediction.”

5. Demonstration (2:30 – 4:00)

Visual: Screen recording of the web app in action.
Dialogue:

“Let me show a demo. I’ll paste a news article text here, or upload an image of a news screenshot.
The system first extracts and translates the text.
Then it shows the ML prediction, the entity extraction, and cross-checks via Wikipedia and NewsAPI.
If the NLI server is running, it also reports any contradictions detected.
The final output combines all these checks to classify the news as real or fake.”

6. Future Enhancements (4:00 – 4:30)

Visual: List of enhancements on screen.
Dialogue:

“Future improvements could include:

Using advanced transformer models for even better NLI accuracy.

Supporting more languages for global news detection.

Adding confidence scoring and explainable predictions for transparency.

Integration with social media feeds for real-time detection.

Developing a mobile application for easier access.”

7. Conclusion (4:30 – 5:00)

Visual: Project logo or “Thank You” slide.
Dialogue:

“In conclusion, the AI Fake News Detector provides a robust, automated approach to detect misinformation using multiple verification techniques. It demonstrates how OCR, NLP, ML, and knowledge APIs can be combined for real-world impact. Thank you for watching.”

Tips for Recording

Use screen recording software like OBS Studio or Camtasia to capture the demo.

Keep visuals synchronized with your narration.

Use high-quality audio and speak clearly.

Keep the video around 5 minutes for conciseness.

Highlight key features with annotations or arrows in your demo.
